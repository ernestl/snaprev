# Design

This document describes the architecture and key design decisions behind revmap.

## Overview

revmap is a read-only CLI tool that queries the Snap Store's dashboard API to display revision and version history for published snaps. It authenticates using the same macaroon-based scheme as snapcraft. When authentication is unavailable or insufficient, it falls back to pre-built compressed cache files bundled in the snap.

## Authentication

### Version

The binary version is set via one of two mechanisms:

1. **ldflags (release builds)** -- `go build -ldflags "-X main.version=1.0.0"` sets a package-level `version` variable in `main.go`, which is passed to `cmd.SetVersion()`. Output: `revmap 1.0.0`.

2. **VCS build info (dev builds)** -- When `version` is empty, `runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo()` extracts the git commit hash (`vcs.revision`) and dirty flag (`vcs.modified`). Output: `revmap dev (abc1234)` or `revmap dev (abc1234, dirty)`.

Cobra's built-in `Version` field provides the `--version` flag automatically.

### Macaroon Scheme

The Snap Store uses a two-macaroon authentication model:

1. **Root macaroon** -- Obtained from the store's ACL endpoint (`POST /dev/api/acl/`) with `package_access` permission. Contains a third-party caveat that must be discharged by Ubuntu One SSO.

2. **Discharge macaroon** -- Obtained from Ubuntu One SSO (`POST /api/v2/tokens/discharge`) using email, password, and optional OTP. Bound to the root macaroon's signature before use.

The authorization header sent with every request:

```
Macaroon root="<root>", discharge="<bound-discharge>"
```

Macaroons are serialized with `base64.RawURLEncoding` (URL-safe, no padding) and backed by `gopkg.in/macaroon.v1`, matching snapd's implementation.

### Credential Storage

The credentials file path is resolved with the following priority:

1. `$SNAP_USER_COMMON/credentials.json` -- When running as a snap (strict confinement). This directory persists across snap refreshes, unlike `$SNAP_USER_DATA` which is versioned.
2. `$XDG_DATA_HOME/revmap/credentials.json` -- When `XDG_DATA_HOME` is set.
3. `~/.local/share/revmap/credentials.json` -- Default.

The file contains JSON with the serialized root and discharge macaroons (`{"r":"...","d":"..."}`), written with `0600` permissions.

The `REVMAP_STORE_CREDENTIALS` environment variable overrides file-based storage. It auto-detects two formats:

1. **Snapcraft export format** -- The INI-style output from `snapcraft export-login`, containing `macaroon` and `unbound_discharge` fields under `[login.ubuntu.com]`. This is the recommended approach for CI pipelines.

2. **Base64-encoded JSON** -- Standard base64 encoding of the credentials JSON file (`{"r":"...","d":"..."}`). Useful for encoding the file revmap itself creates.

### Auto-Refresh

When the store returns a `401` response with the error code `macaroon-needs-refresh`, the client automatically:

1. Reads the current discharge macaroon from storage
2. Posts it to the SSO refresh endpoint (`POST /api/v2/tokens/refresh`)
3. Saves the new discharge macaroon
4. Replays the original request with fresh credentials

Request bodies are buffered to support replay.

## Store API

### Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/dev/api/acl/` | POST | Request root macaroon |
| `login.ubuntu.com/api/v2/tokens/discharge` | POST | Discharge SSO caveat |
| `login.ubuntu.com/api/v2/tokens/refresh` | POST | Refresh expired discharge |
| `/api/v2/snaps/{name}/revisions/{rev}` | GET | Single revision details |
| `/api/v2/snaps/{name}/releases?page=N&size=500` | GET | Paginated revision listing |

### Pagination

The releases endpoint returns pages of up to 500 revisions, ordered newest-first. Each page includes a `_links.next` URL for the next page.

Pagination stops early based on `FetchOptions`:

- **`Since`** -- When all revisions on a page are older than the cutoff, remaining pages are skipped (valid because pages are newest-first).
- **`Until`** -- Cannot enable early exit alone because newer revisions must be paged through to reach the target window. Sets `FetchAll` internally.
- **`MaxRevisions`** -- Stops after collecting enough unique revisions.

Revisions are deduplicated by revision number across pages.

## Commands

### list

Fetches paginated revision data and displays it as a fixed-width table.

**Time window parsing** (`parseTimeWindow`): Combines `--since`, `--until`, `--limit`, and `--all` flags into a `FetchOptions` struct. Validates mutual exclusivity (`--all` vs `--since`/`--until`) and ensures `--since` is before `--until`. Defaults to 90 days when no scope flags are given. When `--limit` is set without explicit time bounds, the 90-day default is bypassed and all pages are fetched until the count limit is reached.

**Relative time values** (`parseTimeValue`): Accepts `Nd`, `Nw`, `Nm`, `Ny` for relative durations and `yyyy-mm-dd` for absolute dates. `--until` dates are made inclusive by adding `24h - 1s`.

**Row filtering** (`applyFilters`): Applied after fetching, before display. Filters are combined with AND logic:

- `--arch` / `-a` -- Case-insensitive architecture match
- `--status` / `-s` -- Case-insensitive status match
- `--version` -- Case-insensitive regex match against version string
- `--build` / `-b` -- Build type classification (preset or custom regex):
  - `release` -- No `+` or `~` suffix (e.g. `2.75.2`)
  - `git` -- Has `+g`/`+git` suffix, excluding fips/dirty/pre
  - `fips` -- Contains `+fips`
  - `pre` -- Contains `~pre` or `~rc`
  - `dirty` -- Contains `-dirty`
  - Any other value -- Treated as a case-insensitive regex matched against the version string

**Column system** (`resolveColumns`): A registry of column definitions (`allColumns` map), each with a header string, a value extractor function, and a fixed/shrinkable flag. The `--columns` / `-c` flag selects and orders columns.

Default columns: `revision,version,arch,status,created`. Additional: `confinement`, `base`, `size`.

**Table rendering** (`printTable`): Computes natural column widths from data, then iteratively shrinks the widest non-fixed column until total width fits within 80 characters. Overflowing cell values are truncated with `...`. The last column is not right-padded.

### show

Fetches a single revision by number and outputs the JSON response. The `--fields` / `-f` flag filters to specific fields from the nested `revision` object.

### cache-build

Fetches the complete revision history and individual revision details for all snaps listed in `cache-snaps.json`, writing compressed cache files to `cache/`.

**Authentication:** If credentials already exist (user ran `revmap login` or `REVMAP_STORE_CREDENTIALS` is set), they are used directly. Otherwise, `cache-build` checks for `REVMAP_EMAIL` and `REVMAP_PASSWORD` environment variables and performs a non-interactive login via `store.Login(email, password, "")`. The OTP parameter is always empty — the account must not have two-factor authentication enabled. A 2FA-enabled account will return `ErrTwoFactorRequired`, surfaced as `"automatic login failed: two-factor authentication required"`.

**Workflow:**
1. Authenticates (existing credentials or env-var login)
2. Reads `cache-snaps.json` (searched in cwd, `$SNAP/`, or next to executable)
3. For each snap: fetches all releases (paginating to completion with `FetchAll: true`)
4. Concurrently fetches each revision's detail via the revisions endpoint (`--workers` controls parallelism, default 10)
5. Skips revisions that return 404 (some entries in the releases list may have been deleted)
6. Writes `cache/<snap>.json.gz` — gzip-compressed JSON containing the full `CacheData` struct

**Cache data structure** (`store.CacheData`):
```go
type CacheData struct {
    Snap      string                            // snap name
    CachedAt  time.Time                         // build timestamp
    Revisions []RevisionEntry                   // full revision list
    Details   map[string]map[string]interface{} // revision number → detail JSON
}
```

### demo

Locates and executes `demo.sh` with the current binary path set as `REVMAP`. Searches for the script in `$SNAP/bin/`, next to the executable, or the current working directory. Supports `--no-pause` for non-interactive execution.

## Cache Fallback

Both `list` and `show` commands implement a two-tier fallback to cached data:

1. **No credentials** -- If `CredentialsExist()` returns false, attempt to load from cache immediately. Notice: `"Using cached data from <date> (run 'revmap login' for live results)"`.

2. **Permission error** -- If the store returns 401, 403, or 404 after authentication, fall back to cache. Notice: `"Using cached data from <date> (insufficient permissions for live data)"`. This handles users who are logged in but lack access to a particular snap.

3. **No cache available** -- If neither credentials nor cache exist, return an error: `"no cache available for <snap> (<reason>)"`.

**Cache file resolution** (`store.FindCacheFile`): Searches in order:
- `$SNAP/cache/<snap>.json.gz` (inside snap at runtime)
- `<executable-dir>/cache/<snap>.json.gz`
- `./cache/<snap>.json.gz` (development, running from project root)
- `./<snap>.json.gz` (running from inside the cache directory)

**Local filtering on cached data** (`applyCacheTimeWindow`): When serving from cache, the same time window and limit flags (`--since`, `--until`, `--limit`, `--all`) are applied locally against the cached revision list. The default 90-day window is applied when no scope flags are given. Row filters (`--arch`, `--build`, `--version`, `--status`) work identically on cached data.

**Error classification** (`isCacheFallbackErr`): Matches error strings containing "status 401", "status 403", or "status 404" — the patterns produced by `store/revisions.go` and `store/client.go`.

## Testing Strategy

Tests focus on pure logic functions that don't require network access or interactive I/O:

- **`cmd/list_test.go`** -- Time parsing, column resolution, build type matching, row filtering, string truncation, column value extractors
- **`cmd/show_test.go`** -- Field list parsing, JSON field filtering
- **`cmd/version_test.go`** -- Explicit version setting, dev fallback, build info extraction
- **`store/auth_test.go`** -- Macaroon serialize/deserialize roundtrip, URL-safe encoding, caveat ID extraction
- **`store/credentials_test.go`** -- Save/load/clear lifecycle, file permissions, env var override, error cases
- **`store/client_test.go`** -- Refresh detection across JSON variants (underscore vs hyphen keys, multiple errors, empty/invalid bodies)

Not tested (require integration/real API): `store/revisions.go` (HTTP client methods), `cmd/login.go`/`cmd/logout.go` (interactive I/O), `main.go`.

## Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `github.com/spf13/cobra` | CLI framework |
| `golang.org/x/term` | Secure password input (no echo) |
| `gopkg.in/macaroon.v1` | Macaroon creation, serialization, binding (matches snapd) |

## Snap Packaging

The snap is built with `snapcraft` using `base: bare` (no runtime base snap) and `confinement: strict`. The build process:

**`override-pull`:**
1. Clones from git (LP) or copies local source
2. Sets version from `git describe`
3. Copies pre-built `cache/` from `$CRAFT_PROJECT_DIR` into the build tree (local builds only — this directory is gitignored, so it only exists when `make cache` was run beforehand)

**`override-build`:**
1. Compiles the Go binary with version from `git describe`
2. Installs `demo.sh` to `$SNAP/bin/`
3. If no `cache/` directory exists (LP/CI path), attempts to run `cache-build` using `REVMAP_EMAIL`/`REVMAP_PASSWORD` from build secrets. The account must not have 2FA enabled.
4. Copies `cache/*.json.gz` to `$SNAP/cache/` (if present)

The snap only requires the `network` plug for store API access. When running from cache, no network access is needed (though the plug is still declared).

**Local build workflow:**

```
revmap login            # one-time interactive login
make cache              # builds binary + fetches all revision data
snapcraft               # override-pull copies cache/, produces .snap
```

**Launchpad build workflow:**

```
# Build secrets configured: store-email, store-password (no 2FA account)
# On push: LP clones from git, override-build runs cache-build with secrets
```
